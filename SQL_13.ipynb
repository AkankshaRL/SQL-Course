    "## WINDOW FUNCTIONS in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are WINDOW FUCTIONS in SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Window functions**, also known as **analytical functions or windowing functions**, are a powerful feature in SQL that allows data analysts to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row within a specified window or frame. Unlike regular aggregate functions, window functions do not group rows into a single result but provide results for each row individually, considering the context of neighboring rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points about Window Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partitioning**: Window functions are typically used in conjunction with the OVER clause to define a partition of the data. The partition divides the result set into groups based on one or more columns, and the window function operates on each partition independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ordering**: To establish the order of rows within each partition, an ORDER BY clause is often used. The window function considers the order to define the window frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Window Frame**: The window frame defines the range of rows that the window function considers for each row. It can be a specific number of rows before and after the current row (ROWS frame), or it can be defined by a range of values (RANGE frame) depending on the ordering of the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Window Functions vs. Aggregate Functions**: While aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) collapse multiple rows into a single result, window functions operate on individual rows and maintain the same number of rows as the original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Common Window Functions**: Some common window functions include `ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE, LAG, LEAD, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, and more`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Window Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a sample table `\"sales\"` with columns `\"product_id,\" \"sale_date,\" and \"revenue\"`. We want to calculate the total revenue for each product and the cumulative revenue for each sale date within each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  product_id,\n",
    "  sale_date,\n",
    "  revenue,\n",
    "  SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS cumulative_revenue\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  sales;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `SUM window function` with the `OVER clause` is used to calculate the cumulative revenue for each product. The `PARTITION BY clause` divides the data into partitions based on `\"product_id,\"` and the `ORDER BY clause` orders the rows within each partition by `\"sale_date.\"` The window frame implicitly considers all rows from the beginning of the partition up to the current row for the `SUM` calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Window Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplified Queries**: Window functions help avoid complex self-joins or subqueries that would be required to achieve similar results without window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Data Analysis**: Window functions enable deeper data analysis by providing insights into the distribution and trends within data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ranking and Percentiles**: Window functions allow the calculation of ranks, percentiles, and other metrics relative to other rows in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time Series Analysis**: Window functions are valuable in time series analysis, where calculations need to consider trends over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use SQL WINDOW FUNCTIONS?\n",
    "\n",
    "To use **window functions in SQL**, you need to understand the syntax and how to combine window functions with the `OVER clause` to define the window frame for calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use window functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax**:\n",
    "The basic syntax of a **window function** is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<window_function> OVER (PARTITION BY <partition_column(s)> ORDER BY <order_column(s)> <window_frame>)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `<window_function>`: The window function to be used, such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, SUM, AVG, etc.\n",
    "- `PARTITION BY`: (Optional) Divides the result set into partitions based on one or more columns. The window function is applied independently to each partition.\n",
    "- `ORDER BY`: (Optional) Defines the order of rows within each partition. It is used to determine the rows considered in the window frame.\n",
    "- `<window_frame>`: (Optional) Specifies the range of rows that the window function considers. It can be a specific number of rows before and after the current row (ROWS frame), or it can be defined by a range of values (RANGE frame) depending on the ordering of the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Window Functions with PARTITION BY**:\n",
    "Window functions are often used in combination with the PARTITION BY clause to calculate results within distinct partitions of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  department,\n",
    "  employee_name,\n",
    "  salary,\n",
    "  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS ranking\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the ROW_NUMBER window function assigns a rank to employees within each department based on their salary in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using Window Functions with ORDER BY**:\n",
    "The ORDER BY clause in the OVER clause specifies the order of rows within each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  department,\n",
    "  employee_name,\n",
    "  salary,\n",
    "  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS overall_ranking\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the RANK window function calculates the overall ranking of employees based on their salary across all departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using Window Functions with WINDOW FRAME**:\n",
    "The WINDOW FRAME clause specifies the range of rows that the window function considers for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with ROWS frame:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  department,\n",
    "  employee_name,\n",
    "  salary,\n",
    "  SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING) AS salary_sum\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the SUM window function calculates the sum of salaries for each employee and the two employees before and after them within the same department.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with RANGE frame:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  sale_date,\n",
    "  revenue,\n",
    "  AVG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 7 DAYS PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_average\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  sales;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the AVG window function calculates the moving average revenue for each sale date within a range of 7 days before the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do SQL WINDOW FUNCTIONS work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Window functions in SQL** operate on a set of rows related to the current row within a specified window or frame. They are distinct from regular aggregate functions because they provide results for each row individually, considering the context of neighboring rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how window functions work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partitioning**:\n",
    "When using a window function, you can define a partition using the PARTITION BY clause. The result set is divided into partitions based on one or more columns specified in the PARTITION BY clause. The window function operates independently on each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ordering**:\n",
    "To establish the order of rows within each partition, you can use the ORDER BY clause. The window function considers the ordering of rows to define the window frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Window Frame**:\n",
    "The window frame determines the range of rows that the window function considers for each row. It can be specified using the ROWS or RANGE keyword in the OVER clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. **ROWS Frame**:\n",
    "      The ROWS frame defines a specific number of rows before and after the current row. For example, `ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING` considers the current row and the rows immediately before and after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b. **RANGE Frame**:\n",
    "      The RANGE frame defines a range of values based on the ordering of rows. It includes rows whose values fall within the specified range. For example, `RANGE BETWEEN 10 PRECEDING AND 10 FOLLOWING` considers rows with values within 10 units of the current row's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Window Function Execution**:\n",
    "The window function is executed for each row in the result set. For each row, the window frame determines which rows are included in the window function's calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result Calculation**:\n",
    "For each row, the window function performs the specified calculation using the rows within the window frame. The result is then included as a separate column in the output for that row.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Row Reduction**:\n",
    "Unlike regular aggregate functions like SUM or AVG, window functions do not reduce the number of rows in the result set. Each row in the result set retains its original values, and the window function's result is appended as an additional column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Window Functions:\n",
    "There are various window functions available in SQL, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROW_NUMBER**: Assigns a unique number to each row based on the specified ordering within the partition.\n",
    "- **RANK and DENSE_RANK**: Assign ranks to rows based on specified criteria, with DENSE_RANK handling ties differently than RANK.\n",
    "- **SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX**: Calculate aggregate values for the rows within the window frame.\n",
    "- **LEAD and LAG**: Access data from subsequent or previous rows relative to the current row.\n",
    "- **NTILE**: Divides the rows within each partition into specified numbers of roughly equal groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's consider a sample table \"sales\" with columns \"product_id,\" \"sale_date,\" and \"revenue.\" We want to calculate the total revenue for each product and the cumulative revenue for each sale date within each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  product_id,\n",
    "  sale_date,\n",
    "  revenue,\n",
    "  SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS cumulative_revenue\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  sales;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the **SUM window function** with the `OVER clause` calculates the cumulative revenue for each product. The `PARTITION BY clause` divides the data into partitions based on `\"product_id,\"` and the `ORDER BY clause` orders the rows within each partition by `\"sale_date.\"` The window frame implicitly considers all rows from the beginning of the partition up to the current row for the SUM calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions in SQL add significant analytical capabilities by allowing calculations to be performed across rows in a partitioned and ordered result set. They provide a powerful toolset for data analysts to gain deeper insights into data patterns, perform ranking and percentile analysis, and enable sophisticated time series calculations. By leveraging window functions effectively, data analysts can elevate their data analysis and gain valuable insights from complex datasets."
