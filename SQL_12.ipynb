    "## DATA WRANGLING with SQL: Transforming Raw Data into Actionable Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is DATA WRANGLING?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the era of big data and data-driven decision-making, the process of **data wrangling** has become a crucial step in turning raw data into valuable insights. **Data wrangling** involves `cleaning, transforming, and preparing data` for analysis, ensuring that it is in a structured and usable format. SQL (Structured Query Language) plays a vital role in data wrangling, as it offers powerful tools to efficiently manipulate and manage data stored in relational databases. In this chapter, we will explore the concept of **data wrangling using SQL** and highlight its importance in the world of **data analytics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data wrangling**, also known as **data munging or data preprocessing**, encompasses a series of tasks aimed at improving data quality and making it more suitable for analysis. The process involves multiple steps, each contributing to the overall transformation of raw data into actionable insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Extraction**: The first step in data wrangling is extracting data from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, or external APIs. SQL's SELECT statement enables data analysts to retrieve specific data columns or entire datasets from relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT customer_id, order_date, order_total\n",
    "FROM orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning**: Raw data often contains errors, missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies that can adversely impact analysis. SQL's data cleaning capabilities, such as NULLIF, COALESCE, and CASE statements, are valuable in handling missing values and ensuring data accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT product_id, product_name, COALESCE(unit_price, 0) AS unit_price\n",
    "FROM products;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Transformation**: Data transformation involves converting data into a format suitable for analysis or combining data from different sources. SQL provides numerous string functions, mathematical functions, and date functions to perform data transformation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT customer_id, UPPER(first_name) AS first_name,\n",
    "       CONCAT(last_name, ', ', first_name) AS full_name\n",
    "FROM customers;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Aggregation**: Data aggregation involves summarizing data to gain insights at a higher level. SQL's GROUP BY clause is essential for aggregating data based on one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees,\n",
    "       AVG(salary) AS average_salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Joins**: Data wrangling often requires combining data from multiple tables or datasets. SQL's JOIN operation allows analysts to merge data based on common columns between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_date\n",
    "FROM orders\n",
    "INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Filtering**: Data filtering is the process of extracting relevant data for analysis based on specific conditions. SQL's WHERE clause is used to filter data based on these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT product_id, product_name, unit_price\n",
    "FROM products\n",
    "WHERE unit_price > 100;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Data Sorting**: SQL's ORDER BY clause is used to sort data in ascending or descending order based on specific columns, facilitating easier analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT product_id, product_name, unit_price\n",
    "FROM products\n",
    "ORDER BY unit_price DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Data Deduplication**: Removing duplicate rows from the dataset is crucial for maintaining data integrity. SQL's DISTINCT keyword or GROUP BY clause can be used for deduplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT category\n",
    "FROM products;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of Data Wrangling in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data wrangling** using SQL is essential for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improving Data Quality**: Data wrangling processes help identify and correct data errors, ensuring high-quality data for accurate analysis and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enabling Data Integration**: SQL's JOIN operation allows data from different sources to be combined, enabling comprehensive analysis from multiple datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhancing Data Usability**: By transforming data into a structured format, data wrangling enhances data usability, making it more accessible and interpretable for analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Supporting Data Analysis**: Aggregating and summarizing data using SQL allows analysts to draw valuable insights and patterns from large datasets.\n",
