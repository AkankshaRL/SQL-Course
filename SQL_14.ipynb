    "## PERFORMANCE TUNING in SQL \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is PERFORMANCE TUNING?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance tuning in SQL** involves optimizing SQL queries and database operations to improve the speed and efficiency of data retrieval and manipulation. The goal is to reduce query response times and resource usage, ensuring that the database performs optimally, especially for large and complex datasets. Performance tuning is essential for applications that rely heavily on databases to deliver responsive and scalable performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key aspects of performance tuning in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Optimization**:\n",
    "   - `Use Indexes`: Properly index columns used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses to speed up data retrieval.\n",
    "   \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees (name);\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `Avoid SELECT *`: Explicitly specify only the required columns instead of using SELECT * to reduce unnecessary data retrieval.\n",
    "   \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT id, name FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "   - `Restrict Result Size`: Limit the number of rows returned using the LIMIT or TOP clause when dealing with large result sets.\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `Use Appropriate Joins`: Choose the appropriate JOIN type (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) based on the relationships between tables to minimize data redundancy.\n",
    "   \n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoid Complex Subqueries**:\n",
    "   - Simplify complex subqueries to reduce the number of nested queries and improve query performance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT e.name, d.department_name\n",
    "FROM employees e\n",
    "INNER JOIN (SELECT id, department_name FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York') d\n",
    "ON e.department_id = d.id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - For large tables, consider partitioning the data into smaller, more manageable chunks to speed up query processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize Transactions**:\n",
    "   - Use appropriate transaction isolation levels to balance data integrity and performance requirements.\n",
    "   - Minimize the use of long-running transactions to reduce locking and contention issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Monitor and Optimize Indexes**:\n",
    "   - Regularly monitor and analyze index usage to identify redundant or unused indexes.\n",
    "   - Rebuild or reorganize fragmented indexes to maintain index performance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_all_indexes WHERE tablename = 'employees';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Database Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Adjust database settings, such as memory allocation and parallel processing, based on the hardware and workload to optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Caching and Query Result Cache**:\n",
    "   - Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently used query results and reduce the need for repetitive queries.\n",
    "   - Utilize the query result cache if available in the database management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Use Materialized Views**:\n",
    "   - Create materialized views for frequently used queries to precompute and store the results, reducing query execution time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employee_sales AS\n",
    "SELECT department_id, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales\n",
    "FROM sales\n",
    "GROUP BY department_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Review Execution Plans**:\n",
    "   - Analyze query execution plans to identify inefficient queries and optimize them using appropriate techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Hardware and Resource Optimization**:\n",
    "    - Ensure the hardware infrastructure meets the database's performance requirements, including CPU, memory, and storage.\n",
    "    - Allocate sufficient resources to the database to handle the workload effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Regular Maintenance**:\n",
    "    - Schedule regular database maintenance tasks like index reorganization, statistics updates, and database backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Benchmarking and Profiling**:\n",
    "    - Use benchmarking and profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and areas that need improvement. For example, in SQL Server, you can use the \"Query Store\" to profile and monitor query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance tuning in SQL** is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, analysis, and adjustment as the database and application evolve. It involves a combination of database design best practices, SQL query optimization, hardware configuration, and database management system configuration to achieve optimal performance and scalability."

    "## PIVOTING SQL DATA\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is PIVOTING DATA in SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pivoting data in SQL** refers to the process of converting rows into columns to create a cross-tabulation or summary of data. It allows you to transform the data's structure, making it easier to analyze and present the information. **Pivoting** is particularly useful when you want to aggregate data based on certain categories or dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the concept with an explanation and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following table \"sales_data,\" which contains information about sales transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "sales_data table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| transaction_id | product | category | sales_amount |\n",
    "|----------------|---------|----------|--------------|\n",
    "| 1              | A       | X        | 100          |\n",
    "| 2              | B       | Y        | 150          |\n",
    "| 3              | A       | Y        | 200          |\n",
    "| 4              | C       | X        | 120          |\n",
    "| 5              | B       | X        | 80           |\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pivoting Data Using SQL Code**:\n",
    "   SQL provides different ways to pivot data, and one common approach is using the `CASE` statement along with aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, or `MAX`. Let's pivot the \"sales_data\" table to show the total sales amount for each category:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT\n",
    "       category,\n",
    "       SUM(CASE WHEN product = 'A' THEN sales_amount ELSE 0 END) AS product_A_sales,\n",
    "       SUM(CASE WHEN product = 'B' THEN sales_amount ELSE 0 END) AS product_B_sales,\n",
    "       SUM(CASE WHEN product = 'C' THEN sales_amount ELSE 0 END) AS product_C_sales\n",
    "   FROM\n",
    "       sales_data\n",
    "   GROUP BY\n",
    "       category;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The result of this query will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "   | category | product_A_sales | product_B_sales | product_C_sales |\n",
    "   |----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n",
    "   | X        | 100             | 80              | 120             |\n",
    "   | Y        | 200             | 150             | 0               |\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, we used the `CASE` statement to create separate columns for each product category (X and Y). The `SUM` function is used to calculate the total sales amount for each product category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pivoting Data Using Table Example**:\n",
    "   Let's consider a table \"order_details\" containing information about the quantity of products ordered by customers:\n",
    "\n",
    "   order_details table:\n",
    "   | order_id | product   | quantity |\n",
    "   |----------|-----------|----------|\n",
    "   | 101      | Laptop    | 2        |\n",
    "   | 101      | Smartphone| 3        |\n",
    "   | 102      | Smartphone| 1        |\n",
    "   | 103      | Laptop    | 1        |\n",
    "   | 103      | Tablet    | 2        |\n",
    "\n",
    "   We want to pivot the data to show the total quantity of each product in separate columns. The resulting pivoted table should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   | order_id | Laptop | Smartphone | Tablet |\n",
    "   |----------|--------|------------|--------|\n",
    "   | 101      | 2      | 3          | 0      |\n",
    "   | 102      | 0      | 1          | 0      |\n",
    "   | 103      | 1      | 0          | 2      |\n",
    "\n",
    "   To achieve this, we can use the following SQL query:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT\n",
    "       order_id,\n",
    "       SUM(CASE WHEN product = 'Laptop' THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Laptop,\n",
    "       SUM(CASE WHEN product = 'Smartphone' THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Smartphone,\n",
    "       SUM(CASE WHEN product = 'Tablet' THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Tablet\n",
    "   FROM\n",
    "       order_details\n",
    "   GROUP BY\n",
    "       order_id;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, we use the `CASE` statement to create separate columns for each product ('Laptop', 'Smartphone', and 'Tablet'). The `SUM` function calculates the total quantity of each product for each order_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pivoting data in SQL** can be highly valuable when summarizing and presenting data in a more compact and insightful format, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex data structures. It allows you to transform rows into columns, making it easier to analyze data from different perspectives and generate meaningful reports."
